# Bitcoin Layers Community Calls

The Bitcoin Layers project hosts weekly community calls with members of the community to discuss things related to Bitcoin scaling protocols.

Community calls are hosted in our [telegram channel](https://t.me/+8rv-1I2gkmQ4ZmJh). The next community call is on April 18th, 2024. Call time is 1pm UTC.

We host calls every week on Thursday, alternating start times between 9am and 3pm UTC.
