- Do we classify rollups on federated sidechains as a different thing than side chains like rootstock?
- - Even if you don’t have an exact definition… can you create a mechanism that shows how the chain interacts with Bitcoin?
  - Yeah this is definitely something we could do.
  - Can do a spectrum like thing to be a bit more opinionated and show there’s a number of nuances related to these designs. 

- Should we create a critical risk thing for projects that have weaker federated multisigs than powpeg or liquid for example?
-  - Yes. Create a critical risk category.
   - If you take the step that everything is a side chain, then you can focus more on the descriptions of the sidechains versus trying to figure out if or what is an L2
   - Lightning is an L2, and not a side chain, because it’s a peer-to-peer. When you get better bridging designs, this becomes a more nuanced question, but for now, creating a distinction between multi-sig security is important
   - Also, it might be worth changing the number of signers to how many can collude, versus how many can participate
